## Purpose of Account
This is where your monthly savings is transferred to. From here, the money is invested in various instruments. This is the account that should be linked to all the financial instrument vending places.

Net Banking is needed for convinience. Debit Card is needed as a mode of payment for buying financial instruments. Credit Card is not needed since no expenditure is to be made from this account.

If married, both partners can maintain their own Invest-it accounts. But, in most Indian households, since it's the husband who takes investment decisions, the husband usually controls this account. However, this account holder should be the same as the one in whose name the financial instrument is purchased.
