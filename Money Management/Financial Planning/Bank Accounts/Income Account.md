# Income Account
## Purpose of account
This account acts as a slump for all the cash inflows. All cash inflows are directed at this account. Ideally, this should be your salary account since it has no Minimum Balance Requirement.

Net Banking is a must. Debit card is needed since it is required for UPI and other transfers. Credit Card is not required since all the expenditures are incurred from Spend-It Account

If married, each partner will have their own Income Account.
